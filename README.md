# Smolson Valley

`compile` and `run` do exactly as they say ;)

### Theme
I want this game to be about escapism and childhood fantasy. Like Stardew Valley, I want to contrast modern life with a pastoral, idealistic fantasy world with the Hololive characters. But unlike Stardew Valley, I want to reflect the unforgiving world in the gameplay itself rather than just in an initial cutscene. Also, instead of entirely uprooting modern life to pursue fantasy, I hope I can incorporate some mechanic to allow the players to compromise and balance the two lifestyles according to their own judgement, as we should in real life.
